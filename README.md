# Decision-Making Analysis in Game Environments

This project explores the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making within a controlled game environment. By analyzing eye and eyebrow features extracted from 478 facial landmarks, we aimed to classify and predict individuals' risky decision-making behaviors.

## Project Overview

Participants engaged in a game consisting of five levels:
- **Levels 1-3:** No biases introduced; purely focused on gameplay.
- **Levels 4-5:** Participants were subjected to anchoring bias and overconfidence bias and Loss Aversion influe.

### Facial Landmark Analysis
We extracted eye and eyebrow features from 478 facial landmarks to study their changes during decision-making.

## Objectives

1. **Classification and Prediction:** Determine if we can classify and predict individuals who make risky decisions based on facial features.
2. **Feature Analysis:** Identify common features that change during risky and safe decision-making.
3. **Bias Effects:** Examine how cognitive biases, such as Loss Aversion bias, affect decision-making.

## Key Findings

- **Eye Feature Changes:** Significant changes in eye features during decision-making.
- **Bias Impact:** Cognitive biases like Loss Aversion influence decision-making processes.
- target 0 for safe decisions and 1 for risky decisions and 2 for no decision

## Usage

To replicate our analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/soroor-ag/Game_Decision-Making_Analysis
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd decision-making-analysis-game
    
3. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install python=3.12
    ```


## Conclusion

Our analysis provides insights into how cognitive biases and facial features correlate with decision-making behaviors. These findings can be expanded in future research to develop more accurate prediction models.
